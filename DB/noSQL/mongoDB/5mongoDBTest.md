5. What is a projection in MongoDB queries?
 It is the second argument in the find() method that may either specify a list of fields to return or list fields to exclude in the result documents.
 It is a condition which specifies the equality condition.
 It is the storage format to store the data into the hard disk.
 It is the query plan to optimize the query.
Explanation:
Answer: (c) Explanation: A projection in MongoDB queries is the storage format to store the data into the hard disk.

By default, queries in MongoDB return all fields in matching documents. To limit the amount of data that MongoDB sends to applications, you can include a projection document to specify or restrict fields to return.

A projection can explicitly include several fields by setting the <field> to 1 in the projection document.

db.inventory.find( { status: "A" }, { item: 1, status: 1 } )

```

```sh
6. Which among the following is the way to access the different documents in the result set?
 Limit
 Sort
 Cursor
 Iterator
Explanation:
Answer: (c) Explanation: Cursor is a way to access the different documents in the result set.


The db.collection.find() method returns a cursor. To access the documents, you need to iterate the cursor. However, in the mongo shell, if the returned cursor is not assigned to a variable using the var keyword, then the cursor is automatically iterated up to 20 times [1] to print up to the first 20 documents in the results.

//////js code
var myCursor = db.sampleCollection.find();

while (myCursor.hasNext()) {
   print(tojson(myCursor.next()));
}

```

8. Which among following is not a supported index type in MongoDB?
 Unique
 Neospatial
 Geospatial
 TTL Index
Explanation:
Answer: (b) Explanation: Neospatial is not a supported index type in MongoDB.


Index Properties
Unique Indexes
The unique property for an index causes MongoDB to reject duplicate values for the indexed field. Other than the unique constraint, unique indexes are functionally interchangeable with other MongoDB indexes.

Partial Indexes
Partial indexes only index the documents in a collection that meet a specified filter expression. By indexing a subset of the documents in a collection, partial indexes have lower storage requirements and reduced performance costs for index creation and maintenance.

Sparse Indexes
The sparse property of an index ensures that the index only contain entries for documents that have the indexed field. The index skips documents that do not have the indexed field.

TTL Indexes
TTL indexes are special indexes that MongoDB can use to automatically remove documents from a collection after a certain amount of time. This is ideal for certain types of information like machine generated event data, logs, and session information that only need to persist in a database for a finite amount of time.

## js emit

In node.js an event can be described simply as a string with a corresponding callback. An event can be "emitted" (or in other words, the corresponding callback be called) multiple times or you can choose to only listen for the first time it is emitted.

The on or addListener method (basically the subscription method) allows you to choose the event to watch for and the callback to be called. The emit method (the publish method), on the other hand, allows you to "emit" an event, which causes all callbacks registered to the event to 'fire', (get called).
