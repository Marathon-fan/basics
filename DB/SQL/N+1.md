What Is The N+1 Query Problem ?

This problem occurs when the code needs to load the children of a parent-child relationship (the “many” in the “one-to-many”). Most ORMs have lazy-loading enabled by default, so queries are issued for the parent record, and then one query for EACH child record. As you can expect, doing N+1 queries instead of a single query will flood your database with queries, which is something we can and should avoid.

Consider a simple blog application which has many articles published by different authors:
```
#Articles model
class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :author
end

#Authors model
class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :posts
end

```


We want to list the 5 most recent articles on the sidebar of the article, along with their title and author’s name.

This could be achieved using the following

```
#In our controller
@recent_articles = Article.order(published_at: :desc).limit(5)

#in our view file
@recent_articles.each do |article|
    Title: <%= article.title %> 
    Author:<%= article.author.name %>
end
```
The above code will send 6 (5+1) queries to the database, 1 to fetch the 5 recent articles and then 5 for their corresponding authors. In the above case, since we are limiting the number of queries to 5, we won’t see this issue affecting our application performance much. However, for queries with larger limit, this could be fatal.

Each query has quite a bit of overhead. It is much faster to issue 1 query which returns 100 results than to issue 100 queries which each return 1 result. This is particularly true if your database is on a different machine which is, say, 1-2ms away on the network. Here, issuing 100 queries serially has a minimum cost of 100-200ms, even if they can be satisfied instantly by MySQL.


Solution – Eager Loading


Eager loading is the mechanism for loading the associated records of the objects returned by Model.find using as few queries as possible. In the above example, if we use eager loading to fetch the data, the details of the author will be loaded along with the articles.

In Rails, ActiveRecord has a method called includes, which ensures that all the associated datas specified are loaded with the minimum number of queries.

Let’s refactor our code to eager load associations.

```
#In our controller
#Using includes(:authors) will include authors model.
@recent_articles = Article.order(published_at: :desc).includes(:authors).limit(5)

#in our view file
@recent_articles.each do |article|
    Title: <%= article.title %> 
    Author:<%= article.author.name %>
end
```


## How Eager Loading Can Prevent The N+1 Query Problem ?


Eager loading is the solution to the N+1 query problem, making sure you don’t end up running unnecessary queries while looping through an object.

The queries in our example go from
```

Article Load (0.9ms) SELECT 'articles'.* FROM 'articles'
Author Load (0.4ms) SELECT 'authors'.* FROM 'authors' WHERE 'authors'.'id' = ? ORDER BY 'authors'.'id' ASC LIMIT 1 [["id", 1]]
Author Load (0.3ms) SELECT 'authors'.* FROM 'authors' WHERE 'authors'.'id' = ? ORDER BY 'authors'.'id' ASC LIMIT 1 [["id", 2]]
Author Load (0.4ms) SELECT 'authors'.* FROM 'authors' WHERE 'authors'.'id' = ? ORDER BY 'authors'.'id' ASC LIMIT 1 [["id", 3]]
Author Load (0.3ms) SELECT 'authors'.* FROM 'authors' WHERE 'authors'.'id' = ? ORDER BY 'authors'.'id' ASC LIMIT 1 [["id", 4]]    
Author Load (0.4ms) SELECT 'authors'.* FROM 'authors' WHERE 'authors'.'id' = ? ORDER BY 'authors'.'id' ASC LIMIT 1 [["id", 5]]
```

to
```
Article Load (0.4ms) SELECT 'articles'.* FROM 'articles'
Author Load (0.4ms) SELECT 'authors'.* FROM 'authors' WHERE 'authors'.'id' IN (1,2,3,4,5)
```
Less queries for great good. :)
