MySQL - Meaning of “PRIMARY KEY”, “UNIQUE KEY” and “KEY” when used together while creating a table

```
A key is just a normal index. A way over simplification is to think of it like a card catalog at a library. It points MySQL in the right direction.

A unique key is also used for improved searching speed, but it has the constraint that there can be no duplicated items (there are no two x and y where x is not y and x == y).

The manual explains it as follows:

A UNIQUE index creates a constraint such that all values in the index must be distinct. An error occurs if you try to add a new row with a key value that matches an existing row. This constraint does not apply to NULL values except for the BDB storage engine. For other engines, a UNIQUE index permits multiple NULL values for columns that can contain NULL. If you specify a prefix value for a column in a UNIQUE index, the column values must be unique within the prefix.
