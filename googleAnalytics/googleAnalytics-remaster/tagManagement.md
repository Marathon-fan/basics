## introducing Google Analytics  

Tags are snippets of code that usually placed in the <head> of a page which enable 3rd-party tracking, analysis, and reporting.


Tag management is a concept that was born out of the increasing need for more agile marketing measurement and tracking ability. Managing and making changes to tags can be tedious and involve unnecessary red tape.


Tag managers allow marketing to have control over their own little space on a web page. The 6 or 7 tags on any given page are replaced by a single container. That container contains code that listens to rules dictated in the tag manager's backend as to when to fire what tags.
