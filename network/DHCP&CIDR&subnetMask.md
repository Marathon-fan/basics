1 DHCP    
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a protocol used to provide quick, automatic, and central management for the distribution of IP addresses within a network.    
DHCP is also used to configure the proper subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server information on the device.

DHCP can be used to:
```
1 configure an IP 
2 configure the proper subnet mask
3 configure the default gateway
4 configure the DNS server 
```

2 subnet mask is the net ID.    
192.168.200.5/30 and 192.168.200.9/30 do not belong to the same network, as the first net ID(subnet mask) is 192.168.200.4, and the second net ID((subnet mask) ) is 192.168.200.8.
